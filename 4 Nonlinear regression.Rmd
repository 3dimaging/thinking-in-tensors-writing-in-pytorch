### Exercise

Which of the following can be described by linear regression:

* without any modifications,
* by after rescaling *x* or *y*,
* cannot be described by linear regression?

**TODO**

* Prepare examples
* 1d function with nonlinearities (by hand and automatically)
* More advanced

```{python}

```
