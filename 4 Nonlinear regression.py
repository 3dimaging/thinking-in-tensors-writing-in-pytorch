# ### Exercise
#
# Which of the following can be described by linear regression:
#
# * without any modifications,
# * by after rescaling *x* or *y*,
# * cannot be described by linear regression?
#
# **TODO**
#
# * Prepare examples
# * 1d function with nonlinearities (by hand and automatically)
# * More advanced
