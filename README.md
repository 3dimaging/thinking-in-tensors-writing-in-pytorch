# Thinking in tensors, writing in PyTorch

A hands-on deep learning introduction, from pieces

## What's that?

Mathematical concepts behind deep learning using PyTorch 1.0. 

* All math equations as PyTorch code
* Explicit, minimalistic examples
* Jupyter Notebook for interactivity
* “On the shoulders of giants” - I link and refer to the best materials I know
* Fully open source & open for collaboration (I guess I will go with MIT for code, CC-BY for anything else)


## Why not something else?

There are quite a few practical introductions to deep learning. I recommend [Deep Learning in Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) by François Chollet (the Keras author). Or you want, you can classify small pictures, or extraterrestrial beings, today. 

When it comes to the mathematical background, [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow et al. is a great starting point, giving a lot of overview. Though, it requires a lot of interest in maths. Convolutional networks start well after page 300.

I struggled to find something in the middle ground - showing mathematical foundations of deep learning, step by step, at the same time translating it into code. The closest example is [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (which is, IMHO, a masterpiece). Though, I believe that instead of using NumPy we can use PyTorch, giving a smooth transition between mathematic ideas and a practical, working code.
